# Quantitative Analyst Broker Frontend

This repository is an **open-source frontend application** for a Quantitative Analyst Broker platform. It provides a user-friendly interface for interacting with advanced quantitative finance algorithms implemented in C++. The application bridges high-performance algorithmic trading strategies with an intuitive interface, enabling users to focus on data and decisions rather than underlying complexities.

## Features

- **Interactive Dashboard**: Visualize market trends, strategy performance, and real-time trading signals.
- **Algorithm Integration**: Leverages high-speed C++ algorithms for calculations, modeling, and trade execution.
- **Customizable Strategies**: Configure algorithm parameters directly from the frontend.
- **Real-time Data**: Connects to live market feeds and updates metrics instantaneously.
- **Modular Design**: Designed for extensibility, allowing users to plug in new strategies or data sources with minimal effort.
